## About this month's competition
The competing Kaggle merchandise stores we saw in [January's Tabular Playground](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jan-2022) are at it again. This time, they're selling books!

The task for this month's competitions is a bit more complicated. Not only are there six countries and four books to forecast, but you're being asked to forecast sales during the tumultuous year 2021. Can you use your data science skills to predict book sales when conditions are far from the ordinary?
